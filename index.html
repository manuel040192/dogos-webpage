            <h2>Dachshund</h2>
            <p>
            Also known as the wiener dog, badger dog, or sausage dog, is a short-legged,
            long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. They may be smooth, wire, or long-haired.
            </p>
            <p>
            The standard-sized dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out
            badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was
            bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits and mice.

            <h2>Corgi</h2>
            <p>
            The Welsh Corgi or Corgi, plural Corgis, is a small type of herding dog that
            originated in Wales.
            </p>
            <p>
            Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan
            Welsh Corgi.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height.
            Their tails are of different shapes.

            <h2>Mongrel</h2>
            <p>
            A mongrel, mutt or mixed-breed dog is a dog that does not belong to one
            officially recognized breed and is not the result of intentional breeding.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although mongrels are viewed as of less commercial value than intentionally
            bred dogs, they are thought to be less susceptible to genetic health problems
            associated with inbreeding.
